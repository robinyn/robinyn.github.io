        <p>This is a paragraph. This is a useful way to separate chunks of text into different paragraphs.
            you can use &lt;br&gt; as linebreaks and it will be rendered accordingly. The paragraph is
            rendered according to the width of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraphs are separated by a whiteline. You can make inline text <strong>bold</strong> by using
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tags. You can also create ordered and unordered lists using
            &lt;ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt; tags, respectively.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Orderd lists are numbered accordingly</li>
            <li>And the listed items are indented automatically</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Unorderd lists are shown as bullet points if no style is specified</li>
            <li>They are also indented automatically</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can use &lt;a&gt; tags to set links to different <a href="https://www.google.com">pages</a></p>
